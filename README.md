# Modules Presentation

End of April 2024 I gave a small talk on C++ modules at a Danish video games
company. This repository contains a summary pdf of the presentation slides,
as well as a folder containing presented code samples.

All the code is built (with Makefile) and tested only with GCC on Ubuntu 23.04.

The code contains some experimentation with modules, most notably a small
templated logging library that uses `std::source_location` for some extra
spice.

Pull requests and issues are generally not accepted. The repository is mostly
provided as-is, intended for those who could not attend the talk but are
still curious.
